## Introductions
This is the chatting website I've made.

Github copilot has helped me for completing some of the codes.

## How to deploy in your own device

1. Download python 3.13 and run `pip install pyinstaller pywebview`
2. Run `build.bat`
3. Find the app in its parent folder

PS: You can just download the binary file in releases section since it was also generated using `build.bat`
